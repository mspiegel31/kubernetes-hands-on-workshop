## What is an orchesration engine?
given a cluster of machines, we specify containers' desired state. The engine makes it happen.  We don't specify which machine does what.

## Docker: Dev & Ops communication
### Inside the container
- a machine
- unique IP, hostname
- Build your perfect snowflake

### Outside the container
- a process
- plug in power and internet
- restart quickly
- scale by launching more

## Physical components of Kubernetes
- `kubectl` cli
- master nodes
- worker nodes
